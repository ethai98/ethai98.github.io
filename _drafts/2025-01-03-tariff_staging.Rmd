**Quick Background:** Regional trade agreements (RTAs) have proliferated
seven-folds since the WTO Uruguay Round concluded in 1995. The WTO
reports that there are about 373 regional trade agreements currently in
force (whereas only 45 in 1995), although the number of "preferential"
trade agreement has gone beyond 730 ([Dür et al. 2014](#0)).

When talking about agreements that liberalize trade in goods, a common
element in most agreements is the tariff schedule. Tariff schedules list
every product code, their description, MFN base rates, and
***staging***. For example, take a look at the US-Korea FTA (i.e.,
KORUS) [tariff
schedule](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/uploads/agreements/fta/korus/Annex_2-B-1_US_Tariff_Schedule.pdf).

Immediately, any reader would be confused about what any of the "staging
category" actually means. Why do "bovine carcasses and halves fresh or
chilled" have two separate staging categories? Why do we even have two
separate HTS codes to describe the same traded good? What is the
difference between A and D staging?

| HTS8     | Description                                                                    | Base Rate    | Staging Category |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|------------------|
| 02011005 | Bovine carcasses and halves, fresh or chld., descr. in gen. note 15 of the HTS | 4.4 cents/kg | A                |
| 02011010 | Bovine carcasses and halves, fresh or chld., descr. in add. US note 3 to Ch. 2 | 4.4 cents/kg | D                |

Let's answer these questions backward. First, in order to understand the
stagings, we need to take a look at the "Tariff Elimination" Annex 2-B
under the "National Treatment and Market Access for Goods"
[chapter](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/uploads/agreements/fta/korus/asset_upload_file904_12701.pdf).

-   duties on originating goods provided for in the items in **staging
    category [A]{.underline}** in a Party’s Schedule [shall be
    eliminated entirely and such goods shall be duty-free on the date
    this Agreement enters into force]{.underline};

-   duties on originating goods provided for in the items in **staging
    category [D]{.underline}** in a Party’s Schedule [shall be removed
    in five equal annual stages]{.underline} beginning on the date this
    Agreement enters into force, and such goods shall be duty-free,
    effective January 1 of year five;

What Annex 2-B tells us is that imports of bovine carcasses and halves
that fit the description in the [general note 15 of the
HTS](/files/pdf/posts/staging/HTS%20General%20Note%2015.pdf) (02011005)
would enter duty-free as soon as KORUS enters into force. On the other
hands, bovine carcasses and halves that fit the description in [US note
3 to HTS Chapter 2](/files/pdf/posts/staging/HTS%20Chapter%202.pdf)
(02011010) would be phased out over five years in equal annual stages.

OK, now that we have figured out what each of the staging categories
means, let's dive into what makes these two product codes different. For
02011005, the general note defines the import of bovine carcasses and
halves not to be counted against the quantity of the tariff-rate quota
if it is imported for non-commercial use.[^1] On the other hand,
02011010 specifies the maximum amount of bovine carcasses and halves in
metric tons allowed to be entered into the US (presumably for commercial
use). The note also includes a table of the quantities allowance for
specific trade partners.

[^1]: For example, the rule applies if the product imported by or for
    the account for any US agency (a); imported for personal use,
    provided that it does not exceed 5 kilograms (b); or it is imported
    not for commercial purposes, but "as samples for taking orders, for
    exhibition, display or sampling at a trade fair, for research, for
    use by embassies of foreign governments or for testing of equipment,
    provided that written approval of the Secretary of Agriculture or
    his designated representative the United States Department of
    Agriculture (USDA) is presented at the time of entry" (c) ([General
    Note 15](/files/pdf/posts/staging/HTS%20General%20Note%2015.pdf)).

| Country                 | Quantity (metric ton) |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| Canada                  | No limit              |
| Mexico                  | No limit              |
| Australia               | 378,214               |
| New Zealand             | 213,402               |
| Argentina               | 20,000                |
| Uruguay                 | 20,000                |
| Other countries or area | 65,005                |

: Hence, the interpretation of 02011010's tariff treatment is that the
duty portion of the tariff-rate quota (4.4 cents/kg) would be phased out
over 5 years, but there would remain the maximum 65,005 metric tons
quota on Korean bovine carcasses and halves. The tariff on the two
bovine variants would look something like this:

| HTS      | Year 1        | Year 2        | Year 3        | Year 4        | Year 5    |
|----------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|-----------|
| 02011005 | 0 cent/kg     |               |               |               |           |
| 02011010 | 3.52 cents/kg | 2.64 cents/kg | 1.76 cents/kg | 0.88 cents/kg | 0 cent/kg |

What implication does tariff phaseout have on the tariff revenue from
importing 65,005 metric tons worth of bovine carcasses each year after
KORUS enters into force versus before? The table below calculates the
dollar amount that would be collected by customs.

| Year   | Tariff Revenue[^2] from 02011010 |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| Year 0 | \$2,860,220.                     |
| Year 1 | \$2,288,176                      |
| Year 2 | \$1,716,132                      |
| Year 3 | \$1,144,088                      |
| Year 4 | \$572,044                        |
| Year 5 | 0                                |

[^2]: 1 metric ton = 1000 kg. Hence, 65,005 metric tons = 65005000 kg.

**Concluding Note:** This is just a technical introduction to the
complicated but super fascinating world of tariff staging. While I only
provided an example on the treatment of bovine carcasses imports from
South Korea, the figures below illustrates the wide variety of tariff
treatment and diversity of phaseout durations across all products with
all US trade partners. Future blog posts will touch on why tariff
staging is economically and politically relevant and what policymakers
and academics can learn from tariff phaseouts.

**Interested in what explains the variation in tariff phaseouts?** My
[job market paper](/files/pdf/research/Thai-JMP.pdf) demonstrates that
the structure of US FTA tariff schedules can be explained not just by
economic factors but also by the executives' interests in insulating
themselves electorally.
