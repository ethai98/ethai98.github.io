### The Strategic Use of Tariff Phaseouts in US Free Trade Agreements

\*Presented at IHS Trade Symposium (Harvard, July 2024); GSIPE APSA 2024 Pre-Conference and APSA 2024 (Philadelphia, September 2024); GSIPE Fall 2024 Virtual Webinar (October 2024), PEIO (Harvard, January 2025)

> **Abstract:** Rules prescribing the duration of tariff elimination are common in modern free trade agreements (FTAs) and are assigned differentially and selectively to sensitive products, as their extensive use incurs opportunity costs for more exporters. What explains the variation in allocation and duration of tariff phaseouts? Beyond mitigating import competition, I argue that executives design FTA tariff schedules to serve both electoral and ratification goals. I test my argument using a novel dataset on tariff treatment at the tariff line level across all 13 FTAs ratified by the United States. I find that US presidents allocated longer tariff phaseout duration to products made by industries concentrated in swing states to electorally insulate themselves and districts of protectionist legislators to buy their silence. Both effects are stronger when the partner poses a greater import threat. This paper is the first to demonstrate the dual focus of negotiating carve-outs in international agreements.
