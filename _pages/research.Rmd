> **Abstract:** How do presidents design free trade agreements? Nuance has been overshadowed by the simplifying free-trading assumption of the president; indeed, the president can be selectively protectionist to promote free trade. I argue that the president uses tariff phaseouts, heretofore an understudied provision, as a form of targetable temporary protection to buy the median legislator's ratification vote and shield import-sensitive regions. I test these predictions using novel product-level tariff phaseout data from 14 U.S. free trade agreements (FTAs) signed between 1992 and 2015, linking these protections to specific districts. I find that presidents allocate more tariff phaseouts in import-sensitive regions and districts of legislators closer to the median, which increases the likelihood of them ratifying the FTA. Such targeting is limited to FTAs negotiated during divided government. This paper is the first to empirically test the median voter theorem in the context of inter-branch allocation of goods to achieve political ends.

### Deferring Punishment From Trade Liberalization: How Tariff Phaseouts Delay Economic and Political Consequences

> **Abstract:** Can international trade agreements be designed to delay political fallout? I argue that phasing out tariffs can delay adverse economic and political consequences. I test these hypotheses using the case of NAFTA, whose tariff schedule was negotiated prior to the Clinton administration, providing a quasi-exogenous variation on phaseout allocation. First, I establish that industry employment reacts differently depending on the phaseout duration. Second, counties sensitive to imports without a NAFTA tariff phaseout punished Democratic presidential candidates immediately. In contrast, areas with phaseouts penalize them later once tariffs are completely phased out. Third, Democratic Representatives are at greater risk of being voted out of office if they ratified NAFTA; however, greater phaseout coverage for their district mitigates such risk. This article presents one of the first pieces of evidence to suggest that highly particularistic and targeted provisions of trade agreements can delay electoral backlash, which carries implications for how incumbent presidents may utilize such a tool to insulate themselves electorally when committing to free trade.
