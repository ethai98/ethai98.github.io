### The Strategic Use of Tariff Phaseouts in US Free Trade Agreements

\*Presented at IHS Trade Symposium (Harvard, July 2024); GSIPE APSA 2024 Pre-Conference and APSA 2024 (Philadelphia, September 2024); GSIPE Fall 2024 Virtual Webinar (October 2024), PEIO (Harvard, January 2025)

> **Abstract:** Rules regarding the duration of tariff elimination are ubiquitous in modern free trade agreements (FTAs). Yet, phaseout durations are allocated differentially and selectively as extensive usage incurs opportunity costs for more exporters. How does the executive determine which products are politically sensitive? Beyond mitigating import competition, I argue that the sources of political sensitivities stem from the executive's interests in either electorally insulating themselves or facilitating FTA ratification. I test my argument using a novel dataset on tariff treatment at the tariff line level for all 13 FTAs ratified by the United States. I find that, on average, longer tariff phaseouts are allocated to products in industries concentrated in more electorally competitive states, especially for highly import-sensitive products. While the political motivation differs by agreement, the executive cannot address both at once. These findings demonstrate that the executives' particularistic preferences partly influence the structure of FTA tariff schedules.
