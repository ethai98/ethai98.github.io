> **Abstract:** How do US presidents liberalize trade in the shadow of congressional politics? Conventional wisdom suggests that a strategic president would maintain the pro-trade coalition in Congress by limiting tariff cuts on important goods. What happens when all dutiable import tariffs must be cut per WTO rules on preferential trade agreements? I argue that the president should strategically phase out specific tariffs in free trade agreements, as opposed to eliminating tariffs immediately, to buy Congressional support. Specifically, I argue that the executive targets phaseout to the median legislator as they are cost-efficient and credible in ratification promises. Controlling for districts' economic needs, I find that a greater share of a district's workforce is covered by tariff phaseout the closer the representative is to the median on trade issues. However, more tariff phaseouts do not necessarily translate to a higher likelihood for ratification, suggesting that it is one empirically testable part of a bundle of demands fulfilled to buy median legislators' ratification votes.
