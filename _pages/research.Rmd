### The Strategic Use of Tariff Phaseouts in US Free Trade Agreements

\*Presented at IHS Trade Symposium (Harvard, July 2024); GSIPE APSA 2024 Pre-Conference and APSA 2024 (Philadelphia, September 2024); GSIPE Fall 2024 Virtual Webinar (October 2024), PEIO (Harvard, January 2025)

> **Abstract:** Rules regarding the duration of tariff elimination are common in modern free trade agreements (FTAs) and are assigned differentially and selectively to sensitive products, as their extensive use incurs opportunity costs for more exporters. How does the executive determine which products are politically sensitive? Beyond mitigating import competition, I argue that the sources of political sensitivities stem from the executive's interests in either insulating themselves electorally or facilitating FTA ratification. I test my argument using a novel dataset on tariff treatment at the tariff line level across all 13 FTAs ratified by the United States. I find that, on average, longer tariff durations are allocated to products in industries concentrated in more electorally competitive states, especially for highly import-sensitive products. While the political motivations differ by agreement, the executive cannot address both concerns simultaneously. These findings demonstrate that the executive's particularistic preferences partly shape the structure of FTA tariff schedules.
