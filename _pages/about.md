Eric Thai is a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at the University of California, San Diego, specializing in international political economy, particularly the politics surrounding trade agreement design, tariff phase-outs, and the role of interest groups. His research explores the intersection of international political economy, international organizations, and domestic politics. His dissertation, titled "The Political Economy of Tariff Phaseouts in Free Trade Agreements," examines (1) how the preferences of competing interest groups shape the design of tariff schedules across bilateral FTAs and (2) how the concentration of tariff phaseouts reacts to and shapes the political geography in the United States

As a first-generation immigrant from Vietnam with Cantonese cultural heritage, Eric is the first in his family to pursue a Ph.D. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science, summa cum laude, from the University of California, Davis. Eric's early life was split between Ho Chi Minh City/Saigon and the San Gabriel Valley, known locally as "the 626."Â 

Eric has been a ceramic hobbyist in his free time since March 2023. He enjoys making and gifting ceramic goods to friends and family.
